In this assignment we are using medical data collected over a 15 year period from real patients and measured their risk of developing heart disease.
In our analysis we have first tuned hyperparameters to create the best logistic regression model to predict this heart disease risk. We then analyized the features of this model and ranked them in terms of their overall value in predicting our outcome variable (heart disease).

Our findings told us that waist size, hip size, race, and weight were all very significant in predicting heart disease. This outcome makes intuitive sense and validates that our logistic regression model is working as intended.
